# MultiAlgoForNNProb
A python program for implementing and comparing for multiple NN algorithm(kd-tree, LSH, etc) 

Introduction
---

The multi-algo-for-nn is an local application which could help user quickly using several different algorithms to search a large database for the nearest neighbor of a given sample. Also user could compare the performances of each algorithm by program outputs data of time/space consuming and accuracy of results.

Brief Instructions
---

1, Clone whole project into local computer.

    git clone https://github.com/sunwu555/MultiAlgoForNNProb.git
    
2, Go to LSHash_Master directory. 
    
    cd LSHash_Master
        
3, Install the LSHash library by

    pip install e .
    
4, Go to kd-tree directory.

    cd kd-tree
    
5, Install the kd-tree libarary by 

    pip install e .
