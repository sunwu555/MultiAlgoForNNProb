# MultiAlgoForNNProb
A python program for implementing and comparing for multiple NN algorithm(kd-tree, LSH, etc) 

Introduction
---

The multi-algo-for-nn is an local application which could help user quickly using several different algorithms to search a large database for the nearest neighbor of a given sample. Also user could compare the performances of each algorithm by program outputs data of time/space consuming and accuracy of results.
